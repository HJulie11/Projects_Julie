This project is on the progress of development as a part of a course 'Informatics Large Practical'.
The goal is to develop a drone-based food delivery system for students of Informatics school of the University of Edinburgh.

Project requirement:
* Implement an algorithm to find an optimal path for the drone to fly, which **excludes** restricted area or safety and ethical reasons
* Functional and non-functional requirement considered are written in '**Project report.pdf**'.
* Use Restful API 

**Language Used:** Java, RESTful API

Project Approach (Implementation):
* A*(A-star) algorithm
* The algorithm enables finding the optimal path with the least cost
* It uses heuristics to visit fewer nodes.
* LngLat class is defined to be used as node that the algorithm can explore.
* Use RESTful API to thrive data from
* More detail on implementation is described in '**Project report.pdf**'.
